# esphome-trane

An [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) component for monitoring and controlling Trane HVAC systems that use the **ComfortLink II** communicating bus, enabling local control through Home Assistant without any cloud dependency.

Inspired by and structurally modeled after [esphome-econet](https://github.com/esphome-econet/esphome-econet).

---

## Overview

Trane ComfortLink II systems communicate over a proprietary 50kbps CAN bus connecting the thermostat, SC360 zone controller, air handler, and outdoor unit. This project taps that bus to parse the JSON-encoded messages and raw float frames, exposing full system state to Home Assistant.

Confirmed working on:
- **Thermostat**: Trane UX360
- **Controller**: Trane SC360
- **System**: Trane ComfortLink II variable-speed heat pump with gas auxiliary heat

Other ComfortLink II systems using the SC360 controller are likely compatible — field reports welcome.

---

## Features

- **Climate entity** with heat, cool, heat_cool, fan_only, and off modes
- **Presets**: Home, Away, Sleep, Boost
- **Real-time sensors**: refrigerant circuit temp, compressor demand %, supply/return air temp, room temp, humidity, setpoints
- **System status**: operating mode, demand stage (HP Stage 1/2, ID Stage 1/2, HP2+ID1/2), run timer, active alarms
- **Fault detection**: captures `IndoorStatus.E` fault strings (e.g. `TA_INV_HI`) as a dedicated text sensor
- **Passive local decode** of Trane JSON and binary telemetry, including CANopen SDO transport
- **Control API preserved but fail-closed on `dev`** until the newly identified CANopen SDO writer is implemented and qualified
- **Sub-device grouping**: entities appear under four logical devices in HA
  - Trane Thermostat UX360
  - Trane SC360 Controller
  - Trane Air Handler
  - Trane Heat Pump

## Hardware

### Required

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| M5Stack AtomS3 | ESP32-S3 based, tested and confirmed |
| M5Stack CAN bus module | Plugs directly onto the AtomS3 |
| 24VAC to 5VDC converter | Powers the ESP from the system's 24VAC supply |

Other ESP32-S3 boards with a CAN transceiver should work — adjust `tx_pin` and `rx_pin` in the YAML to match your wiring.

### CAN Bus Connection

Tap the four wires from the ComfortLink II bus at the SC360 or any accessible point in the daisy chain:

| Wire | Signal |
|---|---|
| 24VAC | System power (to 24VAC→5VDC converter) |
| H | CAN High |
| L | CAN Low |
| GND | Ground (common to 24VAC→5VDC converter) |

> ⚠️ The bus runs at **50kbps**. This is configured in the YAML — do not change it.

> ⚠️ Use a dedicated 24VAC→5VDC converter to power the ESP. Do not attempt to power it directly from the 24VAC supply without conversion.

### ESP32 CAN Pin Assignment (M5Stack AtomS3 + CAN module)

```yaml
tx_pin: GPIO5
rx_pin: GPIO6
bit_rate: 50kbps
```

## CAN Bus Architecture

The target Trane Link bus is 50-kbit/s classic CAN with a substantial standard
CANopen management/transport layer plus Trane-specific application objects.

| CAN ID / range | Current interpretation |
|---|---|
| `0x000` | CANopen NMT |
| `0x701`–`0x705` | CANopen heartbeat/error-control nodes observed on target |
| `0x7E5` / `0x7E4` | CANopen LSS manager/server |
| `0x601/0x581`, `0x641/0x5C1`, `0x649/0x5C9` | CANopen SDO channel pairs carrying Trane JSON |
| `0x380`–`0x38F` | Outdoor-unit telemetry/status family |
| `0x280`–`0x320` | Indoor/blower/refrigerant telemetry family |
| `0x490` and related IDs | UX360/zone/status telemetry family |

### CANopen SDO JSON mailbox

Target captures prove that the segmented JSON is **not ISO 15765-2**. It is
standard CANopen SDO download traffic targeting manufacturer object
`0x300A:00`.

For example, a `ZoneStatus` update begins:

```text
0x649 C2 0A 30 00 2E 00 00 00
0x5C9 A0 0A 30 00 07 00 00 00
```

which is a block-download initiate request for object `0x300A:00`, size 46,
followed by the server's block-size response. The JSON data then travels in
standard SDO block segments and finishes with the standard block ACK/end
exchange.

Short messages such as `{"Ack":"200"}` use standard segmented SDO download on
`0x641/0x5C1` (`21/60` initiate, toggle-bit data segments, `20/30`
responses).

See `docs/CANOPEN-LINK-TRANSPORT.md` for the byte-level decode and provenance.

> **Write safety:** the old repository transmitter was written before this SDO
> identification and did not implement a valid SDO transaction. The maintained
> `dev` component now fails closed for application writes until a nonblocking
> CANopen SDO client is implemented and command direction is qualified from a
> captured stock UX360 command transaction.


## Boot Sequence Protocol

On thermostat power-on, a `PowerOnReset1` notification is broadcast on `0x641`. The thermostat then issues a series of `GetProfile` requests via `0x5C1`, triggering the SC360 to emit a full state dump in this sequence:

1. `UnitID` — model number, serial number, firmware build string
2. `SystemOpStatus` — current mode, demand stage, outdoor temp
3. `IndoorStatus` — blower state, humidity/ventilation status
4. `ZoneSettings` — per-zone mode flags
5. `ZoneStatus` — per-zone setpoints, room temps, hold state
6. `ActiveAlarms` — current fault list (if any)
7. `SpOverride` — active setpoint overrides for all zones
8. `PresetSettings` — Home/Away/Sleep setpoints
9. `SystemSettings` — thermostat name, timezone offsets, system config flags
10. `ScheduleSettings` — weekly schedule enable/disable
11. `VersionDetails` — config schema version, alarm database version
12. `ZoneCardState` — zone names and connected wireless sensor serial numbers
13. `ZoningInfo` — zone controller configuration and room name preset list
14. `WeatherData` — ZIP code, city, weather status

After the dump completes, the SC360 switches to delta-update mode — only broadcasting fields that change. This means a freshly booted ESP32 may show stale mode/setpoint values until the first real change occurs. A `GetProfile:SYSOP` request is sent on boot to accelerate initial mode population.

A TLS X.509 certificate is also transmitted on `0x649` channel `"5"` during thermostat boot — likely for mutual authentication between the UX360 and SC360. No action required; observed only.

---

### Float Frames (Outdoor Unit — `0x380`–`0x38F`)

All values are IEEE 754 single-precision floats, little-endian.

| CAN ID | Byte layout | Sensors |
|---|---|---|
| `0x380` | Float 1 (bytes 0–3): unknown (consistently 0.0 or -99.0, possibly unused); Float 2 (bytes 4–7): outdoor air temp (°F) | Outdoor Air Temp |
| `0x386` | Float 1 (bytes 0–3): 50.0°F constant (unidentified — possibly a disconnected or stuck sensor); Float 2 (bytes 4–7): refrigerant circuit temp (°F) | Refrig Sensor B, Refrig Circuit Temp |

> **Refrig Circuit Temp** (`0x386` float 2): reads ~18–19°F during active cooling. This is likely **suction-side refrigerant temperature** or liquid line temperature after the expansion valve — NOT the outdoor condenser coil surface temperature (which would be ~110–120°F in cooling mode).

> **Refrig Sensor B** (`0x386` float 1): consistently reads 50.0°F at startup and in idle. Meaning unknown. Possibly a sensor that is not installed or not used on this system.

---

### Air Handler Frame — `0x490`

The `0x490` frame carries multiple air handler sensor readings. The 5-byte payload appears to multiplex different sensor channels; the exact byte-4 channel encoding is not yet fully decoded. Sensors currently extracted:

| Sensor | Observed range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Return Air Temp | 69–71°F | Return air entering air handler |
| Supply Air Temp | 69–71°F | Supply air leaving air handler (converges with return when system idle) |
| AHU Inlet Air Temp | 28–40°F during cooling | Likely refrigerant temperature at indoor coil inlet (not air temperature) |
| Indoor Coil Temp | 35–40°F during cooling, 90–98°F during heating | Indoor evaporator/condenser coil surface temperature |
| Temp Sensor 1/2/3 | 78–92°F, rising during operation | Unidentified — confirmed NOT duct sensors (system uses static pressure sensing only) and NOT wireless room sensors. Likely outdoor unit or air handler component temperatures (motor, compressor housing, or electronics). |
| Indoor Humidity | 40–55% | |

> **Wireless room sensors** (UX360 wireless accessories) do **not** appear in `0x490`. Their readings are reported via `ZoneStatus.H` for the zone they are assigned to.

---

## Operating State Mapping

Cross-referenced against the Trane Home app activity log:

| App state | CAN bus equivalent |
|---|---|
| Heat | `HcStatus=3`, `SystemOpStatus.C` = `HP Stage 1/2` or `ID Stage 1/2` |
| Cool | `HcStatus=3`, `SystemOpStatus.B` = `B`, `SystemOpStatus.C` = cool stage |
| Defrost | `SystemOpStatus.C` = `HP2+ID1` or `HP2+ID2` |
| Emergency heating | `HcStatus=7`, `SystemOpStatus.C` = `ID Stage 1/2` |
| Fan (post-cycle) | `SystemOpStatus.C` = `--`, `IndoorStatus.D` = `B` (blower running) |
| Idle | `HcStatus=4`, `SystemOpStatus.C` = `--` |
| Standby/lockout | `SystemOpStatus.A` = `E` |

App "Run mode" maps to `SpOverride.HoldType`: timed hold = `"2"`, permanent hold = `"1"`, following schedule = `"0"`.

App "Compressor speed" maps to `OdStatus.B` (0–100%).

App "Outdoor temperature" maps to `SystemOpStatus.E` (float string, SC360 ambient sensor).

---

## Climate Presets

Setpoints derived from observed schedule data on a UX360 / SC360 system:

| Preset | Hsp | Csp | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Home | 68°F | 72°F | Matches observed UX360 PresetSettings |
| Away | 65°F | 82°F | Matches observed UX360 PresetSettings |
| Sleep | 66°F | 70°F | Matches observed UX360 PresetSettings |
| Boost | 74°F | 72°F | No Trane equivalent; raises heat target to encourage aux/gas staging |

These are read live from `PresetSettings` on the bus and updated in the climate entity automatically. The Boost preset uses hardcoded values since there is no Trane equivalent.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Mode on reboot**: The SC360 only broadcasts `SystemOpStatus.B` on mode changes, not on demand. Mode is restored from NVS on boot and self-corrects on the next real mode change.
- **Fan-only mode**: Maps to system off (`C`) on the CAN bus — no dedicated fan-only command has been observed.
- **Heat_cool (auto) mode**: Sends heat (`A`) — the SC360 manages HP/gas staging automatically.
- **Zone 2–6 setpoint writes**: Not yet implemented.
- **`0x380` float 1**: Consistently 0.0 or -99.0; meaning unknown.
- **`0x386` float 1 (Refrig Sensor B)**: Consistently 50.0°F at idle; meaning unknown.
- **Temp Sensor 1/2/3**: Source and exact meaning unidentified.
- **`0x490` byte 4 channel encoding**: Not fully decoded; additional sensor channels may exist.
